*   **Advanced Image Generation Options:** Before generating an image, the user will be offered a choice of artistic styles (e.g., "Photo," "Anime," "Fantasy"). The bot will also provide feedback during generation, such as "Your image is being created, please wait..." to improve the user experience.

*   **Balance Top-Up Functionality:** A new "Top-up balance" button will be added to the "My Account" section. This will guide the user through the process of purchasing additional generation credits.

*   **User Generation History:** A new "My Gallery" section will be introduced where users can view all the images they have previously generated. This allows them to easily find and re-download their creations.

*   **Enhanced Onboarding and Help:** The `/start` command will provide a more detailed welcome message, explaining the bot's key features and showing examples. The "Help" section will be expanded into a small guide covering all available commands and features.

*   **Improved Bot Responsiveness and Error Handling:** The bot will provide helpful messages if an image fails to generate (e.g., "Sorry, an error occurred. Please try again.") or if the user sends a message that the bot doesn't understand, guiding them back to the main menu.
